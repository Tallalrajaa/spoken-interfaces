Spoken interfaces are systems that enable users to interact with technology through voice commands and natural language. They play a crucial role in modern technology by providing hands-free operation, enhancing accessibility for individuals with disabilities, and fostering seamless human-computer interaction. Widely used in virtual assistants like Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple Siri, spoken interfaces are also gaining traction in robotics and automation. These systems rely on key components such as speech recognition to convert spoken words into text, natural language processing (NLP) to interpret the input, and speech synthesis for generating responses. In the context of robotics, spoken interfaces allow users to control robots and interact with them in a natural, intuitive way. This project explores the design and implementation of such an interface, focusing on its application in robotics.
